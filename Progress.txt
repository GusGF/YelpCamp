407. Creating the basic express app
===================================
install npm packages express, mongoose & ejs
Import express into our app and create an instance
Setup express (our server) to listen on port 3000 for HTTP requests
Register a HTTP request and send a response back to the requester
Start the server (express) up
Make a simple http get request from the route you setup to makes everything is working
Create a views directory to facilitate our templating engine
	Within create a dummy file called 'home.ejs' with some basic stuff
We're going to be using a templating engine
	Tell express what templating engine we're using
	Import the path module and use it to then tell express where our templates (views) will be
Call a simple template file called 'home.ejs' and render it
