407. Creating the basic express app
===================================
install npm packages express, mongoose & ejs
Import express into our app and create an instance
Setup express (our server) to listen on port 3000 for HTTP requests
Register a simple HTTP get request and send a simple response back to the requester
Create a views directory to facilitate our templating engine:
	Within create a dummy file called 'home.ejs' with some basic HTML
We're going to be using a templating engine:
	Tell express what templating engine we're using
	Import the path module and use it to then tell express where our templates (views) will be
Call a simple template file called 'home.ejs' and render it


408. Campground Model Basics (Mongoose)
=======================================
Create a directory for our Mongoose models:
	Within this directory create campground.js
Require Mongoose
Create a schema called 'campGroundSchema' as follows:
  title: String,
  price: String,
  description: String,
  location: String
Based on the schema create a model and export it
Create a mongoose instance and connect to it:
	mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/yelp-campDB', { 
	  useNewUrlParser: true,
	  useCreateIndex: true, 
	  useUnifiedTopology: true});
Assess whether the DB connection is good or there is an error:
	Set a variable for the Mongoose connection
	If there is an error report it to the console
	If the connection is open report this success to the console
Create a simple 'get' route for when a campground is created '/makecampground'
	Locically it should be a 'post' route but don't worry about this for now.
You will need to require the 'CampGround' model to work with it
Use the 'CampGround' model to create a campground under the above route
	Use the above route to view the object in the browser
